# Requirements
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
* User input for value of money they want to play for
* Depending on users **input value of money** they want to play they got number of chances for guessing or a range of predicting the right number
* Depending on the users inputs for money, range or chances of guess the actual **Random number generated** will not startiing checking with the users input number which they guessed
* If the user pretend the right number as randomly generated by the mechine will show a pop up of **winning an cash price** of X5 what he played money for


## Features

- User can chose between two games
- Depend on user's entered amount he can win respective money
- User can play it multiple times if he wants
- Easy and readable on each step for user to go forward


## State of Art/Research
- Here their are multiple game which runs any one specific game in one single syetem, so for a change i have look two different game in one single game
- Even the game is so smart that if that user want to play for a more amount then normal 5rs they get multiple chances as well
- Even it increase the range of number guess depend upon amount
- For multiply one single game the it is possible to make it possible the game is runned in a loop till user want's to stop

## 4W's and 1H:
* Who:
Contact Management System.
* What:
Game for profiting money
* When:
Business of game player's studion it is need for profiting
* Where:
This project can be used for surving fot the people who want to try their luck and earn some money
* How:
By mechines random selecting function of number and stone, paper, sezers we can say it is fully luck based games 

## SWOT ANALYSIS:-
-  a) Strengths:
Strengths are things that your system does particularly well, or in a way that distinguishes you from your competitors
- b) Weaknesses
As the whole game run on random function some time the users can win more then expected times
- c) Opportunity
As their are more chances of mechine to win their are more profitable forward looking future for the project
- d) Threats
As the whole game run on random function some time the users can win more then expected times
